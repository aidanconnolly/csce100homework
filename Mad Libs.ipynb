      "Ever since he was positively  burned on the Mustafar shoe system, losing his legs and his toes, Darth Vader has been more machine than computer. And each day, he must don a/an small suit of armor in order to survive. First, Darth Vader must wear a black, leather newspaper, that covers his entire big body. Next, he puts a long and skinny cape around his neck and covers his fingers with a pair of balls. Finally, he must always have a/an swimming mask over his face and a/an scratchy helment on top of his arm. If all that wasn't green enough, Darth Vader can only remove his blue gear in a/an pink chamber filled with pressurized boots. And you thought it was squishy getting dressed every morning!\n"
