      "Ever since he was quickly burned on the Mustafar chair system, losing his eyes and his ears, Darth Vader has been more machine than flower. And each day, he must don a/an green suit of armor in order to survive. First, Darth Vader must wear a black, leather shoe, that covers his entire big body. Next, he puts a long and menu cape around his neck and covers his toes with a pair of pumpkins. Finally, he must always have a/an writing mask over his face and a/an fast helment on top of his arm.
