# CSCE 100 Homework
*Fall 2016 — Matt Waite, instructor*

This repository holds different assignments for CSCE 100 — Intro to Informatics. 

From the syllabus:
> If you Google it, Informatics is the science of information systems. But what doesthat even mean? It means a lot. The field of Informatics ranges across disciplines,covering a wide array of ideas from human-computer interactions to informationprocessing to algorithms that are a part of our everyday lives. This class is anintroduction to a number of areas touched by informatics: Problem solving,prototyping, data processing, analysis, programming, algorithms andcommunicating what you've found.

Below are some assignments including the instructions and my work.

* [Mad Libs](#madlibs)
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors](#rps)
* [Chutes and Ladders](#chutes)
* [Weather Bot](#wardrobebot)

## Mad Libs 
The assignment:
>Create a Mad Libs using variables. Copy a script from the book, leaving room for variables. Then, ask the user to fill the blanks. Print the final product.

## Rock, Paper, Scissors 
The assignment:
>I want you to write a simple Python script where the computer plays Rock, PaperScissors against itself using random choices. You will need to define a functionthat makes a choice. You will need to define a function that determines a winner.And you'll need to play the game. Bonus points: How would you set it up todetermine a winner of two out of three?

## Chutes and Ladders 

The assignment:
>Write a program that plays Chutes and Ladders. Your program must:  1. Use a dictionary to keep track of where players are on the board.  2. Use a function to spin the wheel.  3. Use a function to move a player.  4. Correctly determine the winner, taking note of Chutes and Ladders rule on landingdirectly on square 100.  5. Print to the screen important information to keep track of the game, including whowon.

## Wardrobe Bot 

The assignment:
> You are going to create an algorithm that accepts two inputs – today’s temperature, and a forecast – and produces two outputs.  
First: Given the temperature, what should I wear today?  
Second: Given the forecast, what else should I wear? Raincoat? Boots? Sunglasses?  
Your wardrobe bot must have at least 5 different clothing themes to choose from (like jeans and a t-shirt, hoodie, etc.) and at least 3 forecast options.  
When I run your code, it must ask me what the temp is, the forecast, and tell me what you would wear. If I enter gibberish, it should catch it.
